# Neovim configuration

This is my up-to-date Neovim configuration. I have based it on [Christian Chiarulli's](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli) awesome **Neovim from scratch** series. I highly recommend watching the [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctH-a-1eUME&list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ) if you would like to configure and use Neovim for your own development work. You can also visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) if you would like a good starting point for your own configuration.
